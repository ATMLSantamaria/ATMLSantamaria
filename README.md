## About me

My biggest passion is creating and improving excellent products. I deeply enjoy coding and solving algorithmic problems. 
My professional experience involves writing **safety-critical** and **real-time** software in the aerospace industry. 
I worked in a satellite avionics simulator, an aircraft avionics simulator and in a satellite-based GNSS positioning system. 

I have extensive knowledge and interest in C++ programming, especially in using **low latency techniques** and **parallel programming**. I am proficient in:

- Modern C++ (C++17+)
- Metaprogramming and generic programming
- Hardware multithreading and parallel programming
- Low latency data structures and techniques
- Traditional OOP programming
- Algorithmic problem-solving
